# Neopets TVW Notify
Want to conveniently track your volunteering in one place? Well, this is the userscript for you! Simply add this into Tampermonkey and you're good to go.
This is for the 2024 The Void Within plot, so will be kept up-to-date until that finishes.

Feel free to create an issue if there are any problems, or send me a message through another channel.

And if you find it useful, a star would be much appreciated! ‚≠ê

## Features
- Handy link for you to quickly navigate back to the hospital.
- Dynamically updates the time in case there are changes to the shifts.
- Pushes a notification the second your job is finished so you know when to start another.
- Compatible with other Neopets notifications and maintains the count of those.
- Stays out of the way as it directly integrates to an existing sidebar component.
- Job is removed from the list and timer reset when you cancel.
